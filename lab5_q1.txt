When deciding between a structure and an array it is important 
to know the use case for which it is needed. The array can only
store one data type but the elements can be iterated through 
using nothing but an integer as the index. The structure on the
other hand can store multiple data types within it, but each 
element must be reffered to by its variable name.

An array can be used when a lot of a single data type needs to 
be stored and sorted through. For example, a teacher storing 
grades on a particular assignment. All of the scores use the 
same data type (float). The teacher can use an array to sort 
through the grades and find statistics such as the class average, 
minimum, maximum, etc. while keeping the students anonymous.

A structure can be used when multiple data types need to be 
stored while also being stored together. For example, when 
the grades for all assignments need to be stored for a 
particular student. The structure can include the assignments, 
student name, grades, etc. This solution provides scalability 
as well since this structure can be replicated for each student.
