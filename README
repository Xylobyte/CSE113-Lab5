Lab 5

Purpose: To practice utilizing structures in calculations and data storage.

Conclusions:

a) What I learned from this lab:
I learned how to use structures in ways that simplify storing multiple values 
together. This is especially helpful when dealing with values that are related 
and need to be used at the same time.

b) How did the pair programming help/hinder the lab:
This helped me a lot when it came to doing calculations with the values within 
the structures. I got to practice calculating vectors in the prelab which helped 
when I needed to find the distance between two points in the lab.

c) Issues and how I fixed them (bug report):
I ran into some issues with getting the abs() function but fixed it by including 
the stdlib.h library. I had forgotten that it isn't in the math.h library.

d) Improvements that can be made:
In the future, I think I can imrove the menu system in the lab5_q4.c program to 
check the user input for validation.
